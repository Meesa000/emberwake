player: What is that gem in the center? It... doesn't look like any ordinary stone.
shrine_keeper: That’s Elaren’s Eye.
shrine_keeper: It's not  just a relic, it's a warning. Inside are the souls of Hearthstead's enemies, trapped for eternity.
shrine_keeper: Some say you can still hear them, whispering through the crystal.. begging to be let out.
player: ...And you are?
shrine_keeper: I am the shrine keeper.  I have stood watch here for a millennia, bound by oath and duty to Elaren’s Eye. None may enter this sacred shrine, and none may leave.
